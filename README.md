#Implementation of an algorithm to the problem of generating trees minimum labels

### A) The algorithm should solve the problem for a set of instances.
### B) compare the results generated by the algorithm implemented with the results of the literature for the same instâmcias.
### C) Write a report on the results of experiments performed on the bodies.tâncias.

###The results can be visualised <a href="https://github.com/lpbaiser/ApsPAGRM/blob/master/Artigo%20Aps.pdf"/>here<a/>
